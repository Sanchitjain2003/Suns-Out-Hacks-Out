# Team Name: Slackers
## Project Name: Track my hack
The name of my project is Track my Hack. **Track My Hack is a web-based application that helps users, while they are creating their projects for any hackathons or competitions.**
### Aim of Project: To help people in creating projects by prioritizing, aligning, and managing their projects and modules.
### Problem Statement/Inspiration: While creating projects during any hackathon or a competition, we have a lot of ideas popping up. We try to keep our projects as concise as possible but most of the time we end up with a lot of modules in our project. While we create our project, we come across so many hurdles that we decide to forfeit some of the modules or give a twist in the project. Over time, we lose track of the project, this hampers our motive of the project that we had decided initially.

## Technologies used:
- **HTML(Bootstrap)** was used to get some cool HTML templates and CSS files.
- **HTML/CSS** was used to create the webpages for our website. We added styling, hyperlinks, and content to our web app with these languages.
-**Javascript** was used to handle all the backend framework of the web app.
## What is happening in the project?
1. The web app has a screen in which we can type the tasks that we wish to have in the project. 
2. First, we have to type in the project that we need to create, and then we add the to-do tasks about the modules or programs we wish to have in the project.
3. Once, we complete the project or any module, we can click on a button to signify that it is completed.
## Challenges we ran into:
Each time a project gets created, it involves many hurdles and issues. We also faced issues in creating the project:
1. Since I was a beginner in javascript, it took a lot of time for me to code this project. 
2. Google Calendar API integration is left as I have integrated APIs with python side but haven't tried doing that stuff from the javascript side.
3. I have to add more configuration into this project like due dates, extremely important, more prioritization features.
I hope it works out fine.
